# 🌱 Pal-Plant

**A relationship management app that helps you nurture and maintain meaningful connections with friends and family.**

Pal-Plant uses a garden metaphor to visualize your relationships. Each contact is a "plant" that needs regular care—if you don't stay in touch, your plant will wilt!

## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Dashboard
- **Social Garden Score** – An overall health score (0-100) for your relationship network
- **Withering Plants** – Alerts for contacts who are overdue for attention
- **Upcoming Birthdays** – Never miss an important date
- **Scheduled Meetings** – Quick view of upcoming meetups

### 🌿 Contact Management
- **Timer-Based Tracking** – Set custom contact frequency for each person
- **Categories** – Organize contacts into groups (Friends, Romantic, Business, Family, or custom)
- **Plant Health Visualization** – See at a glance which relationships need nurturing
- **Contact History** – Full log of all interactions

### 💬 Interaction Types

- **Vite** – Fast build tool and dev server
- **Capacitor** – Native Android/iOS app packaging
- **Local Analytics** – Event tracking stored locally (no external services)
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** – Push notification infrastructure (requires backend for delivery)
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling (via CDN)
- **Lucide React** – Beautiful icons

### Build for Android

This project uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to package the web app as a native Android application with support for native push notifications.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed

**Steps:**

1. Build the web app and sync with Android:
   ```bash
   npm run cap:sync
   ```

2. Open the Android project in Android Studio:
   ```bash
   npm run cap:open:android
   ```

3. In Android Studio, click **Run** to launch on an emulator or connected device, or use **Build > Build APK(s)** to generate an APK.

### Build for iOS

**Prerequisites:**
- macOS with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed

**Steps:**

1. Build the web app and sync with iOS:
   ```bash
   npm run cap:sync
   ```

2. Open the iOS project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   npm run cap:open:ios
   ```

3. In Xcode, select a target device or simulator and click **Run** to launch the app.

**Note:** iOS builds are supported but have not been extensively tested. Please report any issues you encounter.

## 📖 How It Works

### The Plant Metaphor

Each contact in Pal-Plant is represented as a plant:

| Plant Stage | Percentage | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 🌸 Thriving | 80-100% | Recently contacted, relationship is flourishing |
| 🌳 Growing | 50-79% | Healthy, but check in soon |
| 🌱 Sprouting | 25-49% | Getting close to contact time |
| 🍂 Wilting | 1-24% | Needs attention soon! |
| 💀 Withered | 0% or less | Overdue – reach out now! |

### Scoring System

Your **Social Garden Score** is calculated based on:
- Individual friend scores (based on interaction timing and consistency)
- Verified completed meetings (+5 points each)
- Stale meeting requests (−2 points if pending > 14 days)
- Clamped to a final score between 0 and 100

### Interaction Scoring

| Action | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Regular contact (sweet spot) | +10 | When 0-50% time remaining |
| Regular contact (normal) | +5 | When 50-80% time remaining |
| Regular contact (too early) | −2 | When >80% time remaining |
| Deep connection | +15 | Also grants +12 hours to timer |
| Quick touch | +2 | Adds a small timer extension and is limited to 1 per 2 cycles |
| Overdue contact | −5/day | Up to −30 maximum |
